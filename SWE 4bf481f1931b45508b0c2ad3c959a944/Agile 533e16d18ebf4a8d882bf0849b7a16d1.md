# Agile

- Agile vs Waterfall.
    - Waterfall as a methodology is focused on implementing the components of a software as a whole. So rather than finishing each development step simultaneously, waterfall focuses on finishing each step sequentially. For example, you have to finish the requirements step at first, then designing the software, and after that you can start finishing the implementation. The issue with such approach is that clients can change their requirements, so some steps have to be often revisited.

    - In Agile, each step is revisited every once in a while in an iterative fashion. Basically, you‚Äôre dividing your software development into iterations or sprints. For each sprint, you‚Äôre going through the whole process again to see if changes have taken place (requirements) and start to act upon these changes immediately (this is where the name came from üòÑ). Another advantage that you can deliver functional parts of your software, but in case that your system can be decoupled. If you system has some parts that tightly coupled, hence working simultaneously on different parts, then following the Waterfall model would be more beneficial.

    - NOTE ! : We‚Äôre not slaves to any of the methodologies, we just pick what is suitable for our case.
- Incremental Development vs Iterative Development.

    - **Iterative** development is when teams gradually build up the features and functions but don‚Äôt wait until each of these is complete before releasing.
    - **Incremental** development is a development approach that slices the product into fully working slices that are called increments.
- What are Agile methods ?
    - Agile has many methods, but most famous ones are :
        - Scrum (Widely used and most famous).
        - XP (Extreme Programming).
        - Lean.
        - DSDM.
        - Crystal.
        - FDD.
        - Kanban.
        - And many more.
- How did Agile come into existence?
    - Back in 80s and 90s, some methods were suggested against the Waterfall model.
    - In 2001, a group of 17 methodologists from the industry met to find what is common among their methods.
    - After a couple of days, we got the manifesto ! üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
- What is Agile manifesto ? Discuss each value in the manifesto.

    - The first value emphasize on the interactions between individuals rather than following tools and processes strictly.
    - The second value urges producing a working software rather than producing comprehensive documentation for that software. We‚Äôve already discussed about this point in Software Secrets book, focusing on writing comprehensive documentation is just writing the software once again in another form which is a waste of time in case you didn‚Äôt create a working software in the first place.
    - The third value encourages the collaboration between the custom and the developer. Customers will always ask for changes while the software is under development because they see their product is taking shape, so focusing on contract negotiation as a way of rejecting changes is not a good idea.
    - The last value is to respond to changes rapidly rather than following a plan and stick to it. Sticking with a plan is a disadvantage in the Waterfall model.
    
- Discuss the principles behind the Agile manifesto.
    - There‚Äôre 12 important principles behind Agile:
        
        
        1. **Customer satisfaction is the highest priority** which can be achieved via continuous delivery of valuable software.
        2. **Changing requirements are welcomed**, even late in development.
        3. **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
        4. **Cooperation between business people and developers** throughout the project.
        5. **Build projects around motivated individuals**. Motivating individuals can be achieved by offering a good working environment and trust.
        6. **Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective** way to convey information among development members.
        7. **Working software is the mandatory measure of progress**.
        8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development** . The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
        9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility**.
        10. **Simplicity is essential**.
        11. **Self-organization is important** as the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
        12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

- Agile misconceptions.
    - Agile is not an excuse to stop documentation. To be precise, agile encourages working software over **comprehensive** documentation.
    - Agile is not an opportunity to eliminate planning.
    - Many people are onto agile without knowing what it entails.
- Values vs. Principles vs. Practices in Agile.
    - Agile is a mindset described by 4 values and defined by 12 principles that can be embodied through different agile methods (Scrum, Kanban, XP, etc.).

- What is pair programming ?
    - Pair programming is a practice suggested by XP method (Extreme Programming).
    - In such practice, two developers sit next to each other, one of them is the driver who‚Äôs writing code and the other is the reviewer or the observer that trying to discuss for better ways to achieve the intended goal.
    - Blind application of any practice is not useful, you have to find a use case to apply the practice so you can gain the greatest benefit.
    - Pair programming is great for refactoring and may produce less mistakes.
    - Avoiding isolated islands of experience suffered by many companies.
- Crystal Methodologies.
    - They‚Äôre a family of methods developed by Alistair Cockburn.
    - Based on years of interviewing successful teams, Cockburn had come to conclusions :
        - ‚ÄúEach team interviewed did things slightly different, yet they all succeeded‚Äù.
        - ‚ÄúEvery project is a game and we need to make a strategy to win the game‚Äù. Each project has its own characteristics and require its own practices and policies.
        - ‚ÄúCrystal aims to be a simple and tolerant set of rules that puts the project into the safety zone‚Äù.
    - Crystal methods are the most descriptive (which means it tells you what to do but doesn‚Äôt specify how to do) and least prescriptive (unlike XP in which you have a very strict rules to follow).
    - Crystal mainly focuses on people and interactions over rigid processes and definitions.
    - Cockburn findings on people‚Äôs behavior in teams.
        - Cockburn noticed the following :
            - People are communicating beings, so communication should be done face to face.
            - People have trouble acting consistently over time.
            - People are highly variable from day to day and from place to place.
            - People are generally good citizens, working to get the project to work.
    - Crystal family.
        - Crystal is a family of methods such that each method depends on the size of the team.
        - Each team size should have different strategies.
        - Crystal clear is made for 2 - 8 developers.
        - **Crystal yellow** is made for 9 - 20 developers.
        - **Crystal orange** is made for 21 - 50 developers and so on.

    - Crystal Clear Properties.
        - Mandatory Properties.
            - **Frequent Delivery**
                - It is an important property in crystal clear method. You need to deliver your software frequently whenever your iterations satisfy some of the requirements. In each iteration you have a version of your software that might be released but it may not be sufficient to be released to the clients to obtain their feedback.
                - Notice that an iteration is where the software is built to the point where it could be released.
                - Delivery is where the software is actually released.
                - It might not be convenient to deliver software too often but you should have at least a delivery every two months and your project should have at least two deliveries so to obtain the feedback.
                - Feedback helps in fixing or changing the software in early stages before it‚Äôs finally released.
            - **Reflective Improvement**
                - Crystal encourages teams to hold a ‚Äú**reflection workshop**‚Äù every few weeks to identify the practices, conventions, and habits that work, and to find alternatives for the ones that don‚Äôt. The team can test different strategies until they find one that works for them.
                - Interestingly, Crystal doesn‚Äôt specify the format of the reflection workshop. This could also evolve as the team gains experience with its processes.
            - **Osmotic Communication**
                - If the team size was small (like in crystal clear 6 - 8 members), they should be seated in the same room so that information flows effortlessly between them.
                - In this way, people with high experience can help people with low experience (osmosis). Questions can be asked and answered in seconds, without interrupting either person‚Äôs flow of work.
                - For larger teams (in case of crystal yellow or crystal orange), the requirement is weakened to ‚Äú**close communication**‚Äù because the environment would become noisy and distracting.
        - Important properties.
            - **Personal Safety**
                - Personal safety doesn‚Äôt mean physical safety, but rather the psychological and emotional safety needed to speak up freely without fear of censure or hostility.
                - It‚Äôs important adjunct to both close/osmotic communication and reflective improvement. If anyone asked a question and that question was ridiculed, that would affect the flow of questions and answers badly.
                - The same goes with reflective improvement sessions, they‚Äôd be pointless in case no one speaks up about his/her problems they‚Äôre facing.
            - **Focus**
                - The developer should be working in an environment that has the less amount possible of distractions.
                - It becomes really hard in switching context as the software is highly complex and highly abstract.
                - So it would take time to concentrate on other projects than the one you were working on.
                - These kind of interruptions (like switching context to work on other project) is different from those experienced in the close/osmotic communication. If you notice that your co-workers are really focused on something, you should let them finish and wait for them to take a break before asking your question.
                - Thus thus the 2-hour and 2-day rules are introduced in Crystal to tackle these issues.
                - **Two-hour rule :** A known two-hour window during the day is defined where interruptions are not allowed.
                - **Two-day rule :** If a developer is assigned to work on a project, no switching to work on other projects would happen before two full days.
            - **Easy access  to expert users**
                - The development team should have access to a senior user that can give feedback whether the team is working on the right way and refine the requirements in case any change happens as well as answering any questions. It‚Äôd be really useful if that user is working full-time with the team (recall that it‚Äôs a requirement in XP), but due to other responsibilities that this user has, a weekly two-hour meeting plus the phone calls availability would be sufficient.
                - Managers define the requirements but they don‚Äôt have the idea of how does users do their work, so they‚Äôre (managers) inappropriate for giving feedback.
                - The developers can also fulfil the user‚Äôs role but that is unusual, and potentially expensive. However, it would provide developers with a profound insight into the users‚Äô environment and issues.
            - **Technical Environment with Automated Tests, Configuration Management, and Frequent Integration**
                - This property is based on three technologies :
                    - Configuration Management : which is controlling the access to a master copy of the source code and ensure that each developer works on a particular part of the system at a time (like in Git).
                    - Automating unit tests : Automated tests takes less time than manual testing, you may also want to test some parts of the systems that you‚Äôve made change to and leave other parts. Tests also serve as a documentation for the requirements and the functionality of the software.
                    - Frequent Integration : which can be done by a build process that is scheduled to run on a regular basis.
- XP And Scrum
    - XP and Scrum are already discussed in [Software Engineering - Book Notes.](Software%20Engineering%20-%20Book%20Notes%20c4c54f62a0914cc9a7600907b5a6d50d.md) chapter 3, check it out.
